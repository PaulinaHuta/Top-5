<font face = "Baloo 2">
<p>Traveling to Bali was the main reason I visited Asia for the first time. The incredible photos I had seen of the green rice terraces instantly convinced me to take a trip to Bali.
However, since I was traveling so far, I thought it would be a good idea to visit other 
countries and areas of Indonesia during my trip to Southeast Asia. Ultimately, as time was limited, I spent 7 days in Bali, following the advice Dan had given me after his vacation
in Bali a few months before.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you should know that the influx of tourists in Bali has not stopped growing, and thanks to this, the Balinese live much better than locals in other, poorer islands of Indonesia. However, there are also some drawbacks to tourism in Bali. It's important that we, who are lucky enough to travel to the Island of the Gods, practice responsible tourism in Bali so that we can all continue enjoying the island in the future.</p>

<h3><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">1. Best places to visit in Bali</font></h3>

<p>There are so many places you can't miss on the Island of the Gods that it's difficult to choose. To help you out, we've written a list of 60 things to do in Bali, Indonesia, so you don't miss a thing.</p>
<p>To sum it up, these are the most important attractions to visit during your trip to Bali.</p>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Best temples in Bali</font></h4>

<p>Without a doubt, there is nothing like Bali temples, so the first thing you have to do is pinpoint the most important ones.</p>

<center><img src = "bali3.jpg" width = "500" height = "700"></center>

<h5><center>First Bali Travel Tip: Don't try to visit all the temples</center></h5>
<ul type = "cicle">

<li><b>Besakih Temple:</b> Mother Temple. The biggest temple in Bali.</li>
<li><b>Ulun Danu Beratan:</b> The most photographed temple in Bali, on Lake Bratan.</li>
<li><b>Pura Luhur Uluwatu:</b> Temple on a cliff. An ideal place to watch the sunset.</li>

<li><b>Lempuyang Temple:</b> Temple of the Gates to Heaven.</li>

<p>There are more than 1,000 temples in Bali, so one of the most well known tips for traveling to Bali is not to get frustrated if you can't see them all. Even so, I leave you with a slightly more extensive list of temples in Bali that I recommend you visit.</p>


<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Best rice terraces in Bali</font></h4>

<p>The rice terraces are the best of Bali. Rice is the base ingredient in Balinese cuisine, and as such, rural life revolves around the cultivation of this cereal. If you choose the best time to visit Bali, you'll be rewarded with green rice paddies and unforgettable landscapes.</p>

<p>Although there are many rice terraces in Bali, these are the best ones:</p>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Best beaches in Bali</font></h4>

<p>Taking a trip to Southeast Asia and not planning some time at the beach is a sin. Most of Bali’s best beaches aren't found on the main island, but rather, on the small islands surrounding Bali. These are the beaches that you should not miss.</p>

<center><img src = "bali5.jpg" width = "900" height = "500"></center>

<h5><center>Kelingking Beach: don't miss it on your trip to Bali</center></h5>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Best volcanoes in Bali</font></h4>

<p>Bali is a volcanic island that has a lot of activity. Additionally, the volcanoes of Bali are not just part of the landscape. The religion, customs, and traditions of the Balinese people are intimately linked with the volcanoes of the island.</p>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Best waterfalls in Bali</font></h4>

<p>Visiting the waterfalls of Bali is the best way to get out of the stifling heat. You can even take a dip in some of them. Although most are far from the most touristy sites, on this tour you can see three of the most important Bali waterfalls.</p>

<center><img src = "bali7.jpg" width = "500" height = "700"></center>
<h5><center>Include at least one waterfall in your Bali itinerary</center></h5>

<h3><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">2. Best time to visit Bali</font></h3>
<p>Many people ask us when to visit Bali, and the answer always varies. It's not the same for someone who's very interested in seeing green rice paddies as it is for someone whose reason to travel to Bali is to surf, so we tell you in more detail about the best time to go to Bali in this article.</p>

<center><img src = "bali8.jpg" width = "900" height = "500"></center>
<h5><center>Best time to visit Bali if you want to surf</center></h5>

<p>Most agree that the best time to visit Bali is from April to November, coinciding with the dry season. The monsoon in Bali is from the end of October until April.</p>
<p>What you should know about the weather in Bali is that, unlike other places in Southeast Asia, the monsoon on this island is quite mild, so you can consider any time a good time to visit Bali.</p>
<p>The high season of Bali is considered July, August, and also Christmas, when many tourists decide to spend the holiday season on this island.</p>

<h3><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">3. Flights to Bali, Indonesia</font></h3>

<p>Once you're sure about the Bali itinerary you want to take, it's time to book your flights to Bali.</p>

<p>In my case, I usually book flights three months in advance, since it is statistically when they are cheapest.</p>

<p>The Bali airport that all international flights arrive at is the Ngurah Rai International Airport, which is very close to Denpasar, the capital of Bali.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you'll find it difficult to get direct flights to Bali. Most of the time, you will need to make a connection at the Shanghai or Dubai airport.</p>

<p>I usually use Skyscanner to find the best combination, since you can activate an alert to be notified if the price of flights to Bali drops. The cheapest airline to travel to Bali is usually China Eastern Airlines, although sometimes cheap flights to Bali can also be found with Qatar Airways or Emirates.</p>

<map name = "mymap"><br><br>
<area shape = "rect" coords = "0,0,714,86" href = "https://www.skyscanner.co.il" target = "_blank">

</map>

<br>
<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Cheap flights to Bali:</font></h4>

<p>The cheapest flights to Asia from the US arrive at the airports of Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Kuala Lumpur, so I recommend you take a flight from your home country to one of these airports and from there, take a local flight to Denpasar Airport, since they are the cheapest connections to Bali.</p>

<h3><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">4. Where to stay in Bali</font></h3>

<p>If you already know the exact dates of your trip and your Bali itinerary is ready, it’s time to book your hotels in Bali.</p>

<p>My next Bali travel tip is that you stay in Ubud. Although there are plenty of accommodation options in Bali, Ubud is my favorite area if you plan to take some of the essential tours. For example, to climb Mt. Batur or visit the eastern temples, this area is the best. These are my recommended accommodations in Ubud according to your budget.</p>

<p>In addition, in the surroundings of Ubud, you can find some of the best villas in Bali, at a lower price than you could imagine. If you’ve dreamed of sleeping in the middle of the jungle or enjoying breakfast in your private infinity pool, this is the best place.</p>

<center><img src = "bali9.jpg" width = "900" height = "500"></center>
<h5><center>Where to stay in Bali: there are luxury villas in Bali for less than $100</center></h5>

<p>Another of the places where I recommend staying for a few days is in the southern area, in Uluwatu, where some of the best hotels in Bali are located. Additionally, you'll get better access to other tourist attractions that are in this area, such as, for example, some of the best beaches in Bali.</p>

<h3><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">5. Bali visa information</font></h3>
<p>If you are from one of these 169 countries and are only spending a holiday in Bali (less than 30 days), you have visa exception. Just check that your passport doesn't expire in the next six months from when you enter the country and that you have a couple of blank pages so that they can stamp it and give you an "admission permit."</p>

<p>If you want to spend more time, you'll need a visa for Bali.</p>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Social cultural visa for Indonesia</font></h4>

<p>If you plan to stay more than 30 days in Bali, the best option is to process a social cultural visa for Bali at the Indonesian embassy in your home country.</p>

<p>This visa will last 60 days, but you can extend it for up to 6 months. The price is $50 plus the renewal fee if you would like to stay for more than 60 days.</p>

<p>You can find more information on how to process your visa here.</p>

<h4><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Visa on arrival (VOA)</font></h4>

<p>If you think you'll stay for less than 30 days in Bali but you aren't sure, I recommend you apply for your visa on arrival (VOA) at the arrival airport. This visa only allows you to stay in Bali for 30 days, but, one week before it expires, you can extend it for another 30 days. If you enter Bali without paying the VOA, you will not be able to extend your permit.</p>

<p>The price of the Bali visa on arrival is $35 and you can get it directly at the airport upon arrival. To renew it, you will have to go to immigration several times, so some travelers prefer to hire an agency directly to manage it, although it’s usually more expensive.</p>

<p>Another option, if you've run out of time for renewal or did not request your VOA upon your arrival in Indonesia, is to leave and re-enter the country (either with the visa exception to Bali or with the VOA). You can do it even on the same day, and you will have another 30 days in Bali, although this is perhaps the most expensive option. In addition, it is very likely that they will ask for your flight out of the country to verify that you don't intend to stay in Indonesia longer.</p>
