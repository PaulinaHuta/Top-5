<h2><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Milford Sound</font face = "Bradley Hand ITC"></h2>

<p>Milford Sound is a stunning natural fiord, located on New Zealand's South Island. It extends 15 kilometers inland from the Tasman Sea part of a vast remote wilderness of white snow-capped mountains, glacial lakes and valleys, waterfalls and dense rainforests.. This beautiful natural location draws one million visitors each year, and is one of the country's most popular tourist spots. There are plenty of options for exploring the fiord and its neighbouring sounds. For something adventurous, try canoeing or hiking along the shores. When it rains, you'll be able to take in the spectacular waterfalls which appear.</p>

<h2><font face = "Bradley Hand ITC">Christchurch</font face = "Bradley Hand ITC"></h2>

<p>Christchurch is New Zealand's second-largest city. Most people 
would have heard of Christchurch, from the devastating earthquake and subsequent aftershocks 


the city experienced in 2010 and 2011. Many buildings and tourist facilities were destroyed, however the city is slowly rebuilding and offers a range of tourism options for visitors. Named as one of Lonely Planet's 'top 10 cities' for 2013, Christchurch offers natural sights and plenty of welcoming cafes and places to explore. For something different, drop by the Christchurch Farmers Markets, which take place every Saturday on the stunning grounds of the historic Riccarton House.</p>
